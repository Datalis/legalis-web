              A switch has the markup of a custom checkbox but uses the .form-switch class to render a toggle switch.
              Consider using role="switch" to more accurately convey the nature of the control to assistive technologies
              that support this role. In older assistive technologies, it will simply be announced as a regular checkbox
              as a fallback. Switches also support the disabled attribute.
